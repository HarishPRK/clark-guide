# 🌟 ClarkGuide: Navigate Your Academic Universe 🚀

Ever felt like choosing courses is more confusing than explaining TikTok to your grandparents? Say hello to **StarGuide** - where finding your academic path becomes less "existential crisis" and more "space exploration adventure"! 

## 🔭 What is ClarkGuide?

StarGuide transforms Clark University's course catalog from a boring list of numbers into an interactive cosmic journey. Think "NASA meets academic advising" - but without the $10 billion budget or the freeze-dried ice cream.

> "It's like having Neil deGrasse Tyson as your academic advisor, but without the constant reminders that we're all made of star stuff." - Definitely a real student quote

## ✨ Features That Make Us Sparkle

### 🌌 Knowledge Constellation Visualization
Your academic knowledge displayed as an interactive star map - much prettier than that crumpled course list at the bottom of your backpack!

### 🧠 NLP-Powered Chat Advisor
Ask questions in plain English like "What connects psychology and computer science?" or "What should I take after barely surviving Statistics 101?"

### ⏳ Time-Travel Academic Planning
Slide through semesters to see your academic universe expand. Way more fun than trying to mentally calculate if you can graduate on time!

### 🔄 Interdisciplinary Connection Discovery
Find surprising links between subjects faster than finding connections on your friend's confusing family tree at Thanksgiving.

### 🎨 Clark-Themed Cosmic Design
School spirit meets interstellar aesthetic. We've got more Clark red than a lobster at a university fundraiser!

## 🛠️ Tech Stack That Powers Our Galaxy

- **Frontend**: React with Canvas visualization (because regular tables are so last light-year)
- **Backend**: Python with FastAPI (faster than the speed of a student rushing to add codes before classes fill up)
- **NLP**: spaCy and SentenceTransformers (smarter than the average chatbot, but still can't explain why your roommate never does the dishes)
- **Database**: SQLAlchemy (organizing academic data better than that "system" you have for your class notes)

## 📊 Demo Scenarios

### The Undecided Freshman
Watch as StarGuide helps a confused freshman discover their academic destiny without requiring a single "What am I doing with my life?" crisis!

### The Psych Major Discovering Data Science
Witness the moment when a psychology student realizes they can analyze human behavior AND large datasets - twice the power to judge people's decisions!

### The Computer Science Student Finding Ethics
See a CS student discover philosophy isn't just for people who enjoy circular arguments about whether chairs exist!

## 🌠 The Team Behind the Stars

Created by the cosmic minds of Team AstroCoders for the Clark University AI Hackathon, where we aimed to make academic planning less painful than stepping on a LEGO at 2am.

## 📜 License

This project is licensed under the MIT License - basically meaning you can use it freely, just like those pens you "accidentally" keep from the advising office.

🔮 **Remember**: Your academic journey should be more "exciting adventure" and less "navigating a labyrinth while blindfolded". StarGuide is here to be your cosmic compass through the stars of knowledge! 🌠
